# @cosmjs/launchpad-ledger

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cosmjs/launchpad-ledger.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/launchpad-ledger)

## Supported platforms

This library works with Node.js as well as certain browsers. We use the
[@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/tree/master/packages/hw-transport-webusb)
library to connect to Ledger devices from the browser via USB. You can check the
support status of this library
[here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/tree/master/packages/hw-transport-webusb#support-status).

Note the optional dependencies:

```json
"optionalDependencies": {
  "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid": "^5.23.2",
  "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb": "^5.23.0"
}
```

If you are using this library with Node.js you must install
`@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid`. Youâ€™ll need `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb`
for the browser.

## Running the demo

### Node.js

Connect the Ledger device via USB, open the Cosmos app, then run the demo (this
will also build the package):

```sh
yarn demo-node
```

### Browser

Build the package for web:

```sh
yarn pack-web
```

Host the `launchpad-ledger` package directory, for example using Python 3:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Visit the demo page in a browser, for example if using the Python 3 option:
http://localhost:8000/demo.

Then follow the instructions on that page.
